                    village of Rybotyn, Korop Raion),[8][9] while his father was a native of Sumy.[10][8] His mother
                    worked in construction and moved to Simferopol to study.[10] His father was a military man who
                    passed through Afghanistan, working as a security guard in Crimea, and the two met there.</p>
